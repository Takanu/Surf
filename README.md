Flex
============

Flex is an addon for Blender 2.7x, that enables quick and effective creation of curved objects for 3D concept art and organic modelling.  This plugin is still in development, and as such is going to have bugs and usability issues (although i’ve tried really hard to make sure it’s production ready!)
